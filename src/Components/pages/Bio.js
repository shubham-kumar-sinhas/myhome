    <p>Hello there!</p>
    <p>I'm Shubham, a front-end developer who specializes in React.</p>
    <p> My passion lies in projects that have a people-centric focus and promote social consciousness.</p>
    <p>For me, the most important aspect of any project is the people involved, whether it's the team I work with or the clients I build for. I strive to create projects that bring value and benefits to people's lives.</p>
   <p>I believe in the power of community and enjoy networking and learning from fellow professionals.</p>
    <p>When I'm not immersed in writing code, you'll often find me navigating both virtual and real-world challenges, exploring live music events, and enjoying the cozy atmosphere of my favorite coffee shop.</p>
    <p> Welcome to my small home on the web.</p>
