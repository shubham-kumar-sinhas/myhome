    <p>Hi there!</p>
    <p>I’m Nina, and I’m a front-end developer specialising in React.</p>
    <p>I lean towards projects that are centered around people and are socially conscientious.</p>
    <p>People are the most important part about working on a project, whether that be the team I’m working with or a client I’m building for. I aim to make projects that add value and benefit to the lives of others.</p>
   <p>As a GitNation Resident, I’m an avid tech conference attendee while also staying involved locally at meet-ups in and around my area.</p>
    <p>When I’m not writing code, I’m usually fighting my way through virtual (and real) world pandemics, going to live music events and hanging out at my favourite independent coffee shop.</p>
    <p> Welcome to my small home on the web.</p>
    </div>
